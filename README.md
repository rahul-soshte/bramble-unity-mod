# Bramble API Documentation for the Developer

This documentation explains how the integration of the Bramble API will happen. This document is specifically written to guide you with the Integration procedure of the Bramble API. So as to integrate the Bramble API in the least amount of time and effort. We have decided to break the integration procedure into phases.

## Bramble API Integration Phase 1
In this phase the Bramble Unity Oauth Module files will be sent to you. You will receive them and run the files ( It's a sample Unity scene with the Oauth module integrated ) in your game development environment and give us your feedback. A bit of back and forth feedback will happen at this stage. Bramble Team will make changes considering the feedback you give.

## Bramble API Integration Phase 2
This stage will be a precursor to the next phase where the actual integration to the game will happen. The Oauth Module will be integrated at this stage. But the reward parameters that remain for the particular game will be decided between The Bramble Team and the Game developer based on a algorithm. Those parameters will be finalized and we go ahead with the last phase. A short feedback about the ongoing procedure / product will be taken by the Bramble Team from the game developer. 

## Bramble API Integration Phase 3
Actual Integration will be done in this phase due to the work done in the previous phase. If any more phases are required after these it will be done with discussions amongst the Bramble Team and the Game Developer who has put forward the doubts. At this juncture also we will be giving you a questionnaire to give feedback about the entire experience / product
